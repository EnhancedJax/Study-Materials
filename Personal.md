# Mindset
- The present is all that exists. 5 minutes later its a whole new world
- Worrying about the past and future only drags you down.
- “Do” because of your beliefs, not because of other people 
- All it takes to get back on track is 5 minutes, whether good or not
- Doing something important and not urgent allows you to do something important and urgent
- Interdependence not independence
- To have something you’ve never had, you’d have to do something you’ve never done
- Experience, good or not is valuable
