\section{Financial Statements}
\label{sec:financial_statements}

The financial statements are the primary means of communication between a company and its stakeholders. It allows them to make informed decisions about providing resources to the entity (e.g. investing, lending).

\begin{knBox}
    {Pervasive Cost-Benefit Constraint}
    The benefits of providing finanical information should outweigh its costs.
\end{knBox}

\begin{knBox}
    {Formatting}
    The following are the \underline{required} headers and footers for financial statements:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Name of the company
        \item Title (type of statement)
        \item Specific date covered (At December 31, 2025)
        \item Unit of measure (In millions of dollars)
        \item Bottom: \textit{The notes are an integral part of the financial statements.}
    \end{itemize}
    Some conventions for styling:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Dollar sign for first and total amounts
        \item Line above sub-totals
        \item Double underline for totals
        \item Brackets for negative numbers
    \end{itemize}
\end{knBox}

\begin{theorem}
    {Classified vs. Unclassified Financial Statements}
    A classified financial statement would break accounts into different classes (e.g. current / non-current A\&L), whereas an unclassified financial statement would list all accounts in the same class together.
\end{theorem}

We can build financial statements by referencing your adjusted trial balance.

\subsection{Relations between account types}
\begin{theorem}
    {Extended accounting equation}
    The following equations are based on the definition of the individual items:
    \begin{center}
        \textbf{A}ssets = \textbf{L}iabilities + \textbf{E}quity

        \textit{Retained Earnings} = \textbf{R}evenue - \textbf{E}xpenses

        $\Delta$\textbf{E}quity = \textit{Retained Earnings} - \textbf{D}ividends
    \end{center}
    \textit{Retained Earnings} here is the \textbf{Net income} generated by the business, and what's left of it.

    These relationships \& equations are demonstrated in their respective financial statements:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \nameref{sec:balance_sheet}
        \item \nameref{sec:income_statement}
        \item \nameref{sec:statement_se}
    \end{enumerate}
    \label{thm:relations}
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Income Statement}
\label{sec:income_statement}

Principle: \hyperref[thm:relations]{\textbf{RE} = \textbf{R} - \textbf{E}}

Reports profit / loss \underline{over a period of time}. \textit{Income before / after taxes must be displayed separately}

\subsection{Balance Sheet}
\label{sec:balance_sheet}

Principle: \hyperref[thm:relations]{\textbf{A} = \textbf{L} + \textbf{E}}

The balance sheet is prepared \textbf{after creating the \nameref{sec:closing_entries}}.

Reports the financial position of a company at a \underline{specific point in time}. Helpful for demonstrating the \hyperref[def:current_ratio]{current ratio}.

It is called a \textbf{balance sheet} because the \textbf{left side} (assets) is equal to the \textbf{right side} (liabilities + equity).

\subsection{Cash flow statement}

\subsubsection{Cash flows}

\begin{theorem}
    {Identifying types of cash flows activities}
    The following is a general way to categorize cash flows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Financing}: Changes in shares, borrowing money or repayment of long term debt
        \item \textbf{Investing}: The purchase / sale of long-term assets that sit outside of the businessses' core operations
        \item \textbf{Operating}: Revenue generating activities of a business
    \end{itemize}
    An entry has \textbf{no effect} on cash flow if it doesn't involve cash.

    The direction of cash flow: cash is \textbf{debited} (cash outflow) or \textbf{credited} (cash inflow).
\end{theorem}

\subsubsection{Information needed for preparing cash flow statement}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Comparative} balance sheets (showing current and previous years)
    \item Income statement
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Preparing statement with indirect method}

Principle: Calculate cash flows and check with the change in cash balance.

We generally use \textbf{indirect} method, which is more convenient to prepare. The only difference between the indirect and direct method is the operating activities section. We're just going to focus on the indirect method.

We can calculate the \textbf{cash flow from operating activities by}:
\[ \mathcolorbox{lime}{\text{Net Income}} + \mathcolorbox{pink}{\text{Non-cash expenses} + \text{Gain/Loss on sale of non-current A}} - \mathcolorbox{yellow}{\Delta\text{A\&L}} \]
Which we will do inside the statement. The general steps to prepare the statement are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Calculate change and label type of cash flow (FIO) on the balance sheet, as well as for any additional information
    \item Identify the non-cash expenses (depreciation, amortization)
    \item Identify if there are any gains or losses on the sale of non-current assets
    \item Use the changes in [O] and \textbf{reverse their effects} on the cash flow statement\\
          (e.g. $\uparrow A \rightarrow -ve,\quad\downarrow L \rightarrow -ve$ )
    \item Fill in the rest
\end{itemize}

Note that we use \textbf{payments} and \textbf{proceeds} for financing activities to describe cash outflows and inflows, respectively.
