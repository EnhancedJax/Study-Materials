A business model outlines how certain objectives are achieved, such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Presence of business
    \item Revenue strategy
    \item Pricing strategy
    \item Value proposition
    \item Competition
\end{itemize}


\begin{knBox}
    {Presence of business}
    We categorize the presence based on the level of physical / virtual presence.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Brick and mortar (offline)
        \item Click and Brick (hybrid)
        \item Click only (online)
    \end{itemize}
\end{knBox}

\begin{knBox}
    {Revenue strategy}
    Where does the revenue come from?

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Subscription
        \item Transactional
        \item Advertising
        \item Traditional sales
        \item Affiliate marketing (profit from referrals)
    \end{itemize}
\end{knBox}


\begin{knBox}
    {Pricing strategy}
    How are the products priced?

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Versioning - Multiple versions (e.g. professional, student)
        \item Bundling - Cheaper at bulk
        \item Freemium - Basic free, premium paid
        \item Free trial - Limited time test before purchase
    \end{itemize}
\end{knBox}

\begin{theorem}
    {Long tail strategy}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Profit from selling many low-volume, unique items rather than few high-volume items
        \item Particularly effective in e-commerce where:
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item No physical inventory limitations
                  \item Items easily discoverable online
                  \item Helps compete in crowded markets
              \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    {Product differentiation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Vertical - By Standards
        \item Horizontal - By Tastes
    \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    {Porter's Five Forces of Competition}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Rivalry among existing firms (no. of competitors)
        \item Threat of new entrants (entry barriers)
        \item Bargaining power of buyers (no. of buyers)
        \item Bargaining power of suppliers (no. of suppliers)
        \item Threat of substitutes (no. of alternatives)
