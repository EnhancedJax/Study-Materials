Express the vertexes of the graph as variables of our SAT instance: For each vertex $v_i$, assign corresponding variable $X_i$.

(2)

Assign the meaning of the variable: if $X_i$ is true ? in set $U$ : in set $W$ (partite sets of the graph).

Consider a pair of verticies $v_i, v_j$, if there is an edge between them, then they should be assigned different values (i.e., one in $U$ and the other in $W$).

(3)

To reduce the BGP problem to SAT:

\[\forall (v_i, v_j) \in E: (X_i \lor X_j) \land (\neg X_i \lor \neg X_j)\]

(4)

Proof BGP -> SAT: Based on definition

Proof of SAT -> BGP:
