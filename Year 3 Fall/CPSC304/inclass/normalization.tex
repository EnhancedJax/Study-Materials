Consider a relation $S(G, H, J, K)$. The following FDs are given:
\begin{align}
    G  & \to H \\
    JK & \to G \\
    H  & \to K
\end{align}

Is $S$ in BCNF? Why or why not? If it is not in BCNF:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Decompose into BCNF as covered in class.
    \item Circle the relations in your final answer.
    \item Underline the keys in your final answer.
\end{itemize}

Show your work.

\textbf{Write your answer here:}

Candidate keys:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $(JK)^+ = (JG)^+ = (JH)^+ = \{G, H, J, K\}$
\end{itemize}

Check BCNF:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $G\to H: G^+ = \{G, H, K\}$ is not a key $\implies$ not in BCNF
    \item $JK \to G: (JK)^+$ is a key $\implies$ in BCNF
    \item $H \to K: H^+ = \{H, K\}$ is not a key $\implies$ not in BCNF
\end{itemize}

Decomposition:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Decompose on $G \to H$:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item $R_1(G,H) \quad$ FDs: $G \to H$ is in BCNF as two elements
              \item $R_2(G,J,K) \quad$ FDs: $JK \to G$ is in BCNF     as $JK$ is a key
          \end{itemize}
    \item Decompose on $H \to K$: Can be skipped as $R_1,R_2$ are both in BCNF and $H,K$ are not together in any relation.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Answer}: $S_1(\underline{G}, H), S_2(\underline{J, K}, G)$
