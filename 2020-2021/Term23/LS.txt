:Question Types:
.Describe the trend:
[TS]
In source _, [thing] [changed] [amplitude] from _ to _. (On the other hand, ...) To conclude, [trend].

.Identify and explain one factor:
[factor] might [affection]
From [Source1], . From [Source2], .
As we can see that, [explanation]. If [factor] increase, . On the other hand, if [factor] decrease, .
Therefore, [reiterate factor]

.Identifty and elaborate two concerns:
Regarding [thing], [people] express concerns over [1] and [2].
First, [stakeholder] concerns about [thing].
From [Source]. It implies [potential impacts + elaboration]. The [authority] can [expected actions].
Second, repeat:
From [Source]. repeat:
To sum up, [reiterate concerns]
→ Concerns of stakeholder - what? - why? (impact severity, expected solutions) - features of the issue? How did the concern happen? (potential problems)

.Should [thing] be used? Explain answer:	// There are no comparisons 
[Stance].
First, [TS]. From [Source], . [Elaboration]. Therefore, [stance] because [reason mentioned.]
Second, repeat:
Some say that [opposite stance]. They think that [rebuttal]. However, that isn't true. [Explanation]. 	// Clone of below
Therefore, [reiterate stance] 																			// Same energy

.Is [a] better than [b]? Explain answer:	// Comparison between [a] and [b]
[Stance], because [comparison].
First, in terms of [criterion], [a] is more [criterion] than [b]. // 2nd half is the same as comparison
From [source], . It can be seen that [elaboration]. On the contrary, [source]. It can be seen that [elaboration2]. Therefore, [comparison].
Second, repeat:
From [source], repeat:
Some say that [opposite stance]. They think that [rebuttal]. However, that isn't true. [Explanation]. 	// Clone of above
Therefore, [reiterate stance]																			// Same energy

:Identity:
.Show:
Sense of identity as HKP:
	•	Increasing sense of pride							- sense of belonging / outstanding person / fighting spirit / sense of superiority
	•	Raising concern for local social development		- protests / demands
	•	Increase local consciousness						- change to history, culture, education, languages related items (e.g. support Cantonese, conservation of old buildings)
		-	Preserve trams, as they are the collective memory, local culture and historical symbol of HKP

Sense of identity as Chinese:
	•	National events that we are proud of				- economic development in China / increase in national power / national achievements 
	•	Concern for democratic and social development		- national awareness / concern for mainland human rights
	•	Impact of disasters on national Feelings			- national awareness / landslides and earthquakes
	•	Feelings toward national symbols					- national flag, nation emblem, national anthem

.Factors:
Race and blood relations:
	•	Ethnicity, blood relations, race and language
Historical factors:
	•	British colonial rule widens the gap between development direction of HK and China
	•	After handover, there are more contact between HK and CHina, boosting sense of belonging of some HK people
Political factors:
	•	HK people imposed a policy to restrict contact between HK and China, boosting sense of identity as HK people
	•	When Japan denied war crimes, HK people were furious, boosting sense of identity as Chinese. 
Economic factors:
	•	The rapid economic growth in 1950 generate a sense of superiority among HK people.
	•	The implementation of CEPA and Individual Visit Scheme caused HK people's sense of national identity to increase due to China's increasing national strength
	•	Protest against the parallel traders caused HK's sense of identity to increase (Individual visit scheme caused small shops to shut down due to increasing rent)
	•	People think that the Express Rail Link is not in conformity of the Basic Law, so they show resistance, causing their sense of identity as a HKP to increase.
	•	With the Belt and Road Initiative (一带一路), HKP can participate in mainland's economy, increasing their national identity.

.Why:
Raise self esteem: 											// compare own group to other → develop sense of belonging
Gain a sense of honour: 									// stress the accomplishments of group → defend reputation
Increase sense of security:									// reduce people's sense of impermanence 無常 in social life
Satisfy personal needs:										// they think they possess attitudes, values and personality
Increase social diversity and degree of freedom in society:	// help society develop different senses of identities → create social harmony

.Properties of different types of energy:
Fossil:
	•	Developed technology (Historical factors)
	•	Not limited by geographic setting, can be imported (Less geographical limitations)
	•	Simple energy generation process, cost-effective
Coal 										Oil												Natural gas
 + Rich reserves 							| + Easy extraction and refinement				| + Light carbon dioxide
 + Burned directly							| + Mature technology 							| + Easy transportation (pipes)
 + Low prices								| + Easy transportation (pipes)					| - High price
 + Mature technology 						| - Heavy pollution 							| - Methane can intensify global warming
 - Not save to extract 						| - Oil spills pollute ocean ecology			| - Explosions can occur when treated poorly
 - Heavy pollution 							| - Reserves is concentrated (unstable supply)	| 
 											| - Price can fluctuate easily					| 

Alternative:
	•	Little to none emission of carbon dioxide
	•	Abundant reserves
Combustible ice 							Nuclear energy									
 + Light carbon dioxide						| + No carbon dioxide
 + Easy transportation						| + High power supply
 - Methane can intensify global warming		| + Abundant reserve		
 - Hard to extraction 						| - Low efficiency (30%-40%)
 					 						| - Waste heat generated cause ocean temperature to rise
 				 							| - High construction cost
 											| - High risk of disasters			

Renewable:
	•	No carbon mission
	•	Less pollution
	•	High efficiency
	•	Renewable
Solar energy								Wind energy										Hydro energy
 + Low pollution 							| + Low pollution 								| + Light carbon dioxide
 + Mature technology						| + High efficiency (50%)						| + Easy transportation (pipes)
 + Low operation cost						| - Noise problems								| - High price
 - Restricted by time and weather			| - Restricted by weather				 		| - Methane can intensify global warming
 - Occupies large areas of land 			| - Affect nearby ecology (affect birds)		| - Explosions can occur when treated poorly
 - Difficult to deliver electricity			| - Have to stop when wind is too extreme		| 
 - Components like silicon is toxic			| 												| 
Geothermal energy 							Biomass energy									
 + Low pollution							| + Would not increase concentration of CO2 in atmosphere
 + Rich reserves of geothermal power		| + Rich reserves from faeces and wastes, and unlimited supply of crops
 + Not affected by time and weather 		| - Mistreatment would lead to explosion and greenhouse gas leakage
 + Low price & Cost effective				| - Damage to ecosystem if crops are only for energy
 - Dangerous (earthquakes) 					| - Not cost effective
 - Damage geological structure				| 
 - Bring underground pollutants to surface	| 

.Factors of energy policies:
	•	Safety								(To ensure electricity can be produced, delivered and used safely)
	•	Stable supply						(Ensure electricity supply is stable)
	•	Reasonable prices					(Ensure the electricity charges are reasonable)
	•	Environmental impact 				(To ensure that it will not cause extensive pollution to the environment)
