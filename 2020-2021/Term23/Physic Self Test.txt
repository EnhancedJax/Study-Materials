|/_ slope = n
under watere, virtual images are formed at a higher position
total internal reflection occurs when light goes from denser medium to less dense, and with the angle of incidence is larger than C
i = C, r = 90
object at infinity forms image at focus

move forward, doesn't move
particles same A, diff A
out of phase, same loop = in phase, adjacent loop = antiphase
particles reach max @ diff times, @ same times
energy is trasmitted from place to place, stored in the wave

water wave change in f λ not affect v
Deeper = bend towards, +vλ
Shallower = bend away, -vλ
dipper f = wave f
increasse in gap width: decrease in angle of diffraction
increase in wave frequency: increase in angle of diffraction
constructive = nλ, nodal lines, super posititons
destructive = .5nλ, anti-nodal lines, particles don't vibrate
700 red 400 purple nm
diffraction of waves is only obersable when d is comparable to λ
bright = con, dark = des
YDSE: evenly spaced fringes
Diffraction grating: increasingly spaced fringes, white light at maxima genereate spectrums from purple to red, might overlap

electromagnetic waves no need medium
v = light speed
star: all em waves
radio: use differnet frequnecy to prevent des interference occuring at certain pos

displacement-distance s-d
displacement-time s-t
λ - compression to compression
A - largest displacement from original
T - time for one complete cycle
v - distance shifted / time used
sound source vibrate -> air particle vibrate
loud = con, soft = des
noise cancelling: produce antiphase audi oto create edestructive interference to reduce noise
speed = 340ms-1
infrasound < 20 (audible range) 20k < ultra sound 
further away from sound source = lower volume
