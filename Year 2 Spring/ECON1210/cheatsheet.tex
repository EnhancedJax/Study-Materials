        Suppose initially the chocolate market is in an unregulated equilibrium. If the government imposes a tax of \$30 for each unit of the chocolate sold, the new equilibrium price paid by the consumers will be 95.

        Given the above information, the government’s tax revenue will be \$3300

        Suppose initially the chocolate market is in an unregulated equilibrium. If the government imposes a subsidy of \$20 for each unit of the chocolate sold, the new equilibrium quantity would be 235 units.

        D: $Q=230-2P$; S: $Q=3P-18"$; $Eq = (130.8,49.6)"$; "Price guarantee at \$67 per unit, for when there is insufficient demand. Store the purchased at \$10 per kg. How much quantity brought from guarantee? Producer surplus and guarantee cost?"

        Plot $P=67$ -> intersection with D and S -> $Q=|Q_s-Q_d|$;

        Producer surplus: area under $P=67$ and above $S$. Cost: $Q \times 67 + Q \times 10$;

        "Switch to subsidy policy, how much subsidy needed for 67 per kg? PS and cost?"

        Plot $P=67$ -> intersection with S -> $x=Q_s$ -> intersection with D find $P_d$ -> $ts = P_s - P_d$

        Producer surplus: same, Cost: $|ts| \times Q_s$;

        "D: $Q=590-P$; S: $2.5P-230$; $Eq = (355.71,234.29)$; To reduce the consumer price by 35\%, the subsidy to impose is? The TES will rise by?"

    $P_d = 234.29 \times (1-.35)$; $Q=590-P_d \to Q= 2.5P_s-230 \implies P_s$; $|ts| = P_s - P_d$;

        TES rised is $Q\times |ts| - \frac{|ts| \times (Q-Q^*)}{2}$

        "Suppose impose budget 54000, what is max subsidy?"

        Shift demand (rearrange to subject $P$): $D: P=590-Q+|ts|, S: P=\frac{Q+230}{2.5}$ -> equalize, rearrange to subject Q. \textbf{Subsitute to government expense formula} $54000 = |ts| \times Q \to$ solve for $|ts$ with quad equation.
