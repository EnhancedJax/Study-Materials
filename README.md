# Study-Materials

My personal studying materials and notes. Browse around! You can find hosted versions of the pdfs on [my website](https://jaxtam.dev/notes/). No PDFs are built & tracked on the git repo.

## Quick LaTeX setup for MacOS

(Guide for myself so I don't forget)

1. Install MacTeX from [here](https://tug.org/mactex/)
2. Add the following to your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc`:
   ```bash
   export PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2024/bin/universal-darwin:$PATH
   ```
3. Run `source ~/.bash_profile` or `source ~/.zshrc`
4. Install the latex workshop vscode extension
