# Newton's law
1. An object will remain at rest or uniform motion until acted upon by a resultant force
3. When two bodies interact, they apply forces to one another that are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction

> Normal force pairs act on the surface
> Weight's pair is the gravitational force and acts on earth's mass  

Moving object friction
> Object -> surface: bw
> Surface -> object: fw

Free fall - Only weight is the force acting on the object
Principle of moment - Body in eq if sum of cw = acw moment
Center of gravity - the point at which weight is taken to act
Principle of conversation of energy - energy can't be created or destroyed, but can be transferred from one form to another
Eq - The situation for a body where there is 0 resultant force and moment
Conversation of momentum - Total moment before and after collision is the same, providing that no external forces act

Collision types
1. Elastic - KE conserved
2. Inelastic - KE not conserved
3. Perfectly inelastic - Objects stick to each other

Formula for tension when pulled from a point:
mg /2 = Tsin0

Lift moves up and scale
1. Scale's reading is the reaction force that it acts on the person
2. Initially no acceleration net force = 0
3. Scale (rx) = weight
Accelerate: 
4. Resultant downwards force 
5. Decreases reaction force
6. Scale (rx) < weight
Decelerate:
7. Resultant uppward force
8. Increases reaction force
9. Scale (rx) > weight

Unit 2
============================================================

Upthrust - Weight of fluid displaced by an object
Viscosity - How resistant a fluid is to flowing
Terminal velocity - Const max v of falling object when net force = 0
l: Temp ^ vis v
g: Temp ^ vis ^
Lower viscosity -> Liquid can flow greater distances in the same time

Flow types: 
1. Laminar flow - fluid v at fixed point constant
2. Turbluent flow - Fluid velocity changes over time in unpredictable manner, whorls are formed, material circulates around the edge

Deformation types:
1. Elastic - object returns to original shape
2. Plastic - object is permanently deformed

Stress / strain graphs:
A: limit of proportionality - hooks law doesn't apply past this point
B: elastic limit - material undergoes plastic deformation past this point
C: yield point - material undergoes a sudden increase in extension
E: breaking stress - the maximum stress a material can withstand without breaking

brittle - shatters without deformation
ductile - can be pulled into a long thin shape
strong - a large choice is required to break it

Unit 3
============================================================

Phase difference formula: path difference = lambda / 2pi * phase difference
Super positions - displacement of 2 waves are combined as they pass thru each other
Coherent - Same fre wavelength and consistant wave difference
Wave fronts - Planes which all the points are in phase

Amplitude - A wave's max displacement from eq pos

Transverse waves
- Oscillate perpendicular to the direction of energy transfer

Longitudinal waves
- Oscillate parallel to the direction of energy transfer

Stationary waves:
They are formed from
1. the superposition of 2 waves
2. travelling in opposite direction
3. in the same plane
4. have teh same f, lambda, A
Node point: Remains stationary

Interference: 
Constructive - in phase - 0 - anti nodes - maximum displacement
Desstructive - out of phase - 180 - nodes - no displacement

d v lambda ^ -> angle ^
Huygens' principle - Every point on a wavefront is a point source to secondary waves, waves expand out
-> denser, bend -> normal, v increase
-> less dense, bend <- normal, v decrease
i = C, r = 90
Refraction index & velocity: nv = nv

TIR only occurs when
1. i > C
2. -> less dense medium

Diffraction
- wavelength must be comparable to the slit width

Polarisation
- Only happens to transverse waves
- Unpolarized waves vibrate at all directions
- Polarized waves vibrate in one plane including the direction of travel
Polarisation stress detection
- Filters at 90 to each other bloccks light
- Stress points rotate plane to polarization to allow light
- Darker areas less stress

Reflection
- When density change, waves are reflected from the boundaries of 2 mediums
Ultrasound use of higher frequency
- lambda v
- Resolution ^
- Better detection of air bubbles


How to use oscilloscope setup to measure speed of sound
1. Move speaker -> waves in phase & measure distance from 0cm
2. Move speaker again -> waves in phase again
3. Calculate moved distance
4. Measure T by reading oscilloscope time for 1 oscillation
5. v = lambda / T

Electronscope - v ^ lambda v resolution ^
- the wavelength of electrons are similar to atoms, so diffraction occurs

Electromagnetic waves
- They oscillate in one direction & perpendicular to direction of travel

Light intensity ^ photons emitted ^ electrons emitted ^ current ^

Work function - the min energy required to release a pe from metal surface
Photon - Particle of energy
Photoelectrons - Electrons emitted from pe effect

Why threshold frequency?
- E = hf > wf to release e

Experimental setup of photocells
1. Photon energy > work function @ cathode
2. Photon release e @ cathode, e travel -> anode making a current
3. e is released with range of KE
4. KE ^ Reverse pd ^
5. Forward pd = Vs -> enough to stop e with max ke
Stopping voltage = KE max in eV

Prove of particle nature for instant emission
1. One photon is being absorbed by one electron
2. Photon transfer all their energies to electron

Explaining how observations prove the particle nature
1. Not all frequencies of light can cause emission of pe
P: Photon E = hf > wf to emit electrons
W: Electrons absorbed enough E will be released regardless of f - NOT SEEN
2. The emission of electrons is instantaneous
P: One photon releases one electron
W: Time needed to absorb the energy before releasing electron - NOT SEEN
3. The kinetic energy depends on frequency, but wave theory suggests that it depends on the intensity of light
P: Photon E = hf -> One photon releases electron giving it range of KE -> f ^ eKE ^
W: Intensity ^ eKE ^ - NOT SEEN - Intensity ^ #e emitted ^ eKE unchanged
 
Prove for wave nature
1. Interference / diffraction
2. Bright and dark fringes of a double slit interference experiment
3. Bright fringes occurs when path difference is nlambda, dark fringes occurs when path difference is 0.5nlambda
4. Particle theory suggests no diffraction -> 2 fringes

Excited - Atoms gain energy and move up energy levels
Energy levels - Specific allowed energies
Line spectra - Emission of specific frequencies

Energy levels:
- energy levels are specific
- eleectron excites and deexcites and releases a photon with gained energy
- Photons can only excite electrons if the energy matches an energy level difference
Cause of line spectrum: 
- E = hf
Certain lines only:
- Energy levels are specific
- Only certain energy level differences

============================================================
Unit 4
============================================================

Current - Rate of flow of charge particles
Emf - The energy supplied to the whole circuit per unit charge
Drift velocity - Average velocity of charge carriers

Series: 
- I Constant if physical properties are unchanged
- Sum of pd = emf
Parallel
- Sum I in all branches = total
- V in all branches same

I-V graphs
Ohmic conductor - straight line
Semi-conductor diode - tip up
Filament bulb: volt ^ current ^ temp ^ resistance ^
Negative temperature coefficient thermistor:
temp ^ resistance v

Resistivity & Resistance - For resistivity, the value is the same for any size & shape

The resistance of a component depends on
1. Temperature -> The intensity of vibrations of atoms in a material
2. Energy of electrons -> Number of electrons

LDR - Light intensity ^ resistance v
