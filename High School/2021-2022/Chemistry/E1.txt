Isotopes are atoms w/ same n of p but diff num of n
RIM - the mass of an individual atom of a particular isotope
FIE: energy required to remove one mol of e from gaseous atoms
Orbital: region within an atom which an e is likely to be found
Periodicity - Trend which is repeated.

bombarded with high energy e, remove e to form positive ions
electric field accelerate
magnetic field deflect

lighter, higher charge, further

Highest peak = molecular ion peak
which is: the molecular mass

attraction force from neucleus +
distance of e to nucleus (size) -
shielding -

same : electron are being removed from an increasingly positive ion
change: electron is removed from a lower shell, which is closer to the nucleus

(.)override (+)greater (/)ignored
Decrease down a group (change in period) : 1+ 2+. 3+.
general increase : 1+. 2+ 3/

s -> p : first e- removed is in p orbital, e is partially shielded by s e
p3 -> p4 : p shell has a pair of e, ee repulsion exists between the 2 paired electrons

Deducing electronic structure from successive ionisation energies
How
1. State electronic structure
2. Jumps of IE indicate the change of shells
3. State jumps
What
1. Number of shells
2. Number of electrons, by electronic arrangement
3. in each shell

atomic radius decrease from left to right, number of p increase + nuclear charge increase -> attraction, distance from nucleus to e decrease

i-bond - attraction between oppositely charged ions
c-bond - attraction of shared pair of e and nuclei
m-bond - attraction between delocalised electrons and cations
iso-el - same number of e
d-bond - element donate pair of e to share with element
elec-n - power of an atom to attract e in c-bond
p-bond - one element is more electronegative than other

Ionic bonds
- Size ! Electronstatic attraction ! Strength
- n of p / nuclear charge ! size

Polarisation power

- P-power ^ covalent character
Polarisability 
- size + charge + (more negative)


Covalent bonds
σ-bond: end on overlap
π-bond: overlap of 2 p orbitals

Metallic bonds
Lattice surrounded by sea of delocalised electrons, they travel thru solid when a potential is applied to conduct electricity
Strength: FOR IONS: size v charge ^ charge density ^ number of de- ^ attraction ^ de and ions ^
Thermal: Delocalised electrons and closely packged cations transfer KE
Malleable: Metal layers can slide over one another


Explain why different AX have different bonding than BX: 
A smaller ionic radius (doesn't compare with number of protons as they aren't isoelectronic) -> A more EN than B -> AX EN diff is less than BX EN diff -> AX covalent degree ^

Unit 6
============================================================

Exothermic - increase temp
Endothermic - decrease temp 
Hess Law - enthalpy change of a reaction is independent of the route
Formula: Jmol-1 = - mass of water * c dt / mol of solute

Enthalpy change of reaction can't be measured directly?
- If reversible reaction, endo can't be measured since hard to measure decrease temp when heating
- Hard to measure temp of solid
- Some substance might evaporate

The values obtained by experiments that are used in calculation are different than accurate
1. Heat loss
2. Specific heat capacity is estimated

Experiment setup affection on values
1. Heat loss
2. Evaporation of reactants
3. Incomplete combustion

Why is something in excess?
To allow full reaction of compound

The enthalpy measured at 100kpa and 298k
rx      - when equation quantities of materials react
combus  - when 1 mol of substance is completely burned in oxygen
neu     - when 1 mol of h2o is produced by nutralisation
forma   - when 1 mol of substance formed its element in standard states
atom    - when 1 mol of gaseous atoms is formed from ground state

solution - ionic compound s -> aq
hydration - ion g -> aq
LE - ionic compound s -> g

Mean bond enthalpy - dH of breaking 1 mol of bond in gas state, averaged over different molecules

Mean bond enthalpy calculations are inaccurate because:
1. They vary with environment
2. THey does not include enthalpies for change of state

bond enthalpy = bonds broken - bonds made

============================================================
Unit 7
============================================================

Hydrogen bonds form: Hydrogen is bonded with a small electronegative element

Hydrocarbon boiling point depends on
1. number of points of contact
2. number of electrons
3. hydrogen bonds

HF HI HBr HCl

Solubility:
- Compare the bond strengths between H2O & compound and within H2O & compound, if the strengths are similar -> dissolve
- Solubility is less if bond strength differences are greater

============================================================
Unit 8
============================================================

Oxidation - lose e gain #o
Reduction - gain e lose #o
Oxidizing agent - gain e more easily -> stronger
Reducing agent - lose e more easily -> stronger

Metal oxides react with water to form metal hydroxide
Metal oxides react with h2so4 to form metal sulfate + water

Thermal stability ^ = Decompose v
Thermal stability ^ when charge density decrease => metal ion polarision power decrease => C-O bond strength increase
Group 2 carbonates and nitrates are white solids

When carbonates are heated, they don't decompose or decompose if 2+ or Li+ & give off CO2
When nitrates are heated, the decompose and gives off oxygen, if 2+ or Li+ they also give off NO2

Sulfate can be tested by adding BaCl -> White solid

Flame test problems
1. Impurities may hide other colors
2. Colors are subjective

Cause of flame colors
When an electron excites and deexcites, it releases energy. The wavelength of the energy is in the visible range.

Why is a burette's tip is full?
- When level goes down, the liquid will fill this space instead of going out
Why do we stop adding solution when indicator change color?
- Increase accuracy
Why are there no further titre done?
- concordant titres have been achieved
Why is fist titre's result greater?
1. Air bubble in burette
2. First titre might be rough run

============================================================
Unit 9
============================================================

Activation energy - Min energy that colliding particles must possess for a reaction to occur
Reaction rate - the change in product over time

Collision theory: Two particles must
1. Collide in the right direction
2. with at least the activation energy
to react

MBD graph: number of molecules / kinetic energy
EP diagram: enthalpy / process of reaction

Increase rate of reaction: ALL
-------------------------------
Temperature: The MBD graph peak shifts to the right and lowers in height
- more particles will have energy higher than Ea on average, they'll collide with higher frequnecy
Concentration: No change to MBD graph
- particles will have a higher frequnecy of collision as there are more particles in a volume
Pressure: Affects gas only
Surface area: Affects heterogeneous reactions w/ solids only -> cause for powder
Catalysts: Activation energy shifts to the left
- it provides an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy

Reversible reactions can only happen for closed systems.
Equilibrium: rate of forward = backward reaction -> the concentrations of R & P const
-------------------------------
Temperature: Shift to endothermic side
Concentration: Shift to side with less 
Pressure: Shift to side with less
Catalysts: No change (increases reaction rate of both sides)

To achieve a greater yield:
1. Remove the product as they are formed
2. Reuse unreacted reactants
