Isotopes are atoms w/ same n of p but diff num of n
ram is the average mass of the isotopes of an element compared w/ 1/12 mass of c-12
n = A - Z
e = n
p = Z

Ionic - m nm
Covalent - nm
Metallic - m

M + H2O -> MOH + H2
M2 + H2 -> 2HM

G1 iD w/ water
G2 iD w/ water
G7 iU w/ hydrogen
G0 unreactive

G1 one e must be lost to be stable, outermost shell distance to nucleus increase down the group, weakens attractive force, easier to lose e, more reactive
G7 one e must be GAINED, harder to gain e, less reactive

low mp + (g, l) -> simple molecular
conduct electricity (s) -> giant metallic
conduct electricity (m, aq) -> giant ionic (s)
high mp -> giant covalent (s)

K Na / Ca Mg Al Zn Fe / Pb Cu Hg / Ag Pt Au
7-3 (burn) 
3-4 (steam water)
2-5-1 (explosive bool)

metal + oxygen -> metal oxide
metal + H₂O -> metal hydroxide / oxide + hydrogen
metal + acid -> metal acid + acid (split) [HCl / H₂SO₄]

particles/6.02e23 = mol = g / Σ
mol ratio to find product mass or mol

1.	n[AB] = n in mol of AB
2.	r = mol ratio A:B
3.	n[AB] change -> r
4.	print("n[A] mol of A would react with n[B] mol of B")
5.	print("limitedReactant: <>, comoundInExcess: <>")
6.	r = mol ratio limitedReactant : C

Rust: 2Fe₂O₃ • nH₂O red-brown solid
Oxygen and Water are necessary for rusting
Rust indicator green -> blue

Aluminium oxide is impermeable to Oxygen and Water -> protect Al from further corrosion
Iron(III) oxide is permeable -> can't protect
