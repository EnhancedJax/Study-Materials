# Inorganic analysis
> Basic test
NH3         HCl(g) => White fumes (NH4Cl)
NH4+        NaOH(warm aq) => Gas litmus R B (NH3)
Sulfate     acidified Ba2+ => white pp
Carbonates  H+ acids => Bubbles (CO2)

> Group 7 test
Method 1: Acidified silver nitrate => White cream yellow pp (HX)
Method 2: conc. H2SO4 => White brown purple fumes (HCl, Br2, I2)

# Organic analysis
> Hydroxyl group
Method 1: PCl5 => White fumes (HCl)

> Acids
Method 1: Carbonates => Bubbles (CO2)

> Alchol & derivatives
1 / 2 deg: acidified K2Cr2O7 => Orange, Green
aldehydes: Benedict => B, R
CH3C=O:    Warm alkaline sol. I2 => Yellow pp CHI3

# Essential knowledge
Common drying agent: MgSO4 (Anhydrous, doesn't react)

==================================================================

_Test: Buchner funnel, reflux, Thiele tube_

# Enthalpy change of Rx
ΔH = -mcΔt/n
m = mass of solvent
n = mol of solute
## Procedure
1. Measure T / 30s
2. Add solution at 3 min
3. Measure T / 30s for 5 min
4. Plot T-t graph -> best fit line
5. Extrapolate -> max dT

# Titrations
When to add starch indicator: Near the end point as to avoid solid forming
## Procedure
1. Indicator in burette
2. Drop by drop at end point
3. Record when color changes
4. Repeat to obtain +-0.2 cm3 titres
## Improve accuracy
* White tile
* Swirl close to end point
* Rinse conical flask with distilled water

# Reflux to prepare stuff
## Prepare solution
Cooling when addition:              Reaction exothermic, prevent boiling over
## Reflux
Use of reflux:                      Give complete reaction
Use of condenser:                   Prevent escape of compounds
Continuous stirring:                Reactants do not mix, ensure enough contact
## Separating funnel
Release pressure:                   Invert & remove stopper
## Buchner funnel
Advantages:                         Greater speed, dries P

# Find total order of reaction 
Pouring contents between beakers:   Ensure no R left in one breaker
Use phenol:                         React with Br2 to delay color change
Why V ∝ conc.:                      Total volume constant
Use ethanol in mixture:             Dissolves reagents -> mix to increase rate
## Graph 1: conc. t
0: Linear
1: HL unchanged
2: HL x2
## Graph 2: 1/t conc.
0: Flat
1: Linear
2: Curved

# Recrystallize
1. Dissolve in min amount of hot solvent → saturated solution
2. Filter solution → cool
3. Filter crystals → wash
4. Dry crystals (oven)

Use of preheated funnel:            Prevent crystallization, remove insoluble impurities
Use of Buchner funnel:              Remove soluble impurities
Use of desiccator instead of oven:  Prevent melting
How does x lead to crystallization: Product is less soluble in x
Increased or > 100% yield:          Damp crystals

# Measure mp
Side-arm heated:                    Distribute heat evenly
Mineral oil:                        Allow points > 100°
Different results:                  Different pressure
Pure sample:                        Sharp, close to db
Impure sample:                      Unsharp, lower

# Combustion analysis
Absorb H2O: MgSO4
Absorb CO2: Soda lime

# Find mole of water of hydrated compound
1. Measure mass of sample
2. Heat sample in crucible until mass constant
3. Difference in mass

# Misc
Species in collection apparatus:    Remove unreacted reactants
