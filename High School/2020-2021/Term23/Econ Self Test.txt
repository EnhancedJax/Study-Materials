## To produce (3)
What - type
How - resource
For whom - consumer

## Economies + resource allocation, economic decision (2)
Market-oriented - price signal - private individuals
command - govt cmd - govt decision

## Private property rights (3)
Exclusive right to use and receive income
Right to transfer

## Public enterprise (2)
Government department
Public corporation

## Private enterprise (4)
Sole proprietorship | Partnership | Limited companies

## Properties of private enterprise: (6)
NUM
Decision making

Rate of return
Influencing company decisions in stakeholder's meeting
Maturity date

## For S&B to company: (3)
Obligation to pay interest
Obligation to redeem bonds
diluted control of existing shareholders

Limited liability: If there is a loss, owner's liability is confined to amount of investments to the firm

>> Relative law of demand: 
Ceteris paribus, vice versa
Given increase in price of good by quota
Relative price of HPG in terms of LPG decrease
People would consume more HPG in terms of LPG
The proportion of HPG consumed would increase
The average quality increase

Price functions + trailing explanation: (3)
Consumer: Rationing - Goods were distributed to consumers who were willing to pay the market price
Producer: Allocative - Resources allocated according to change in RP
* : Price - Price help transmit info about consumer's demand of good relative to producer's supply

## Other factors affecting D: (1+3)
related goods: income -> iDn dDi
Competitive - P : iDr
Joint - P : dDr
Derived - Dp : Di

## Other factors affecting S: (3)
Competitive - P : dSr
Joint - P : iSr
Factors of production - Pi : dSp

Elasticity Calc: %ΔQ / %ΔP
Arc Calc: ΔQ/ΔP * (P1+P2)/(Q1+Q2)

## List elasticities:  (5)
>1 %ΔQ > %ΔP
=1 %ΔQ = %ΔP
<1 %ΔQ = %ΔP
= Inf ΔP = Inf ΔQ
= 0 ΔP = 0ΔQ

?? Positive factors affecting elasticity: List 6
1. (D)Substitutes
2. (D)Prop of income
3. (D)Durability
4. (B)Time for adjusting
5. (S)Flexibility of production
6. (S)Ease of entry

?? Negative factors affecting elasticity: List 3
1. (D)Necessity
2. (D)Habit forming goods
3. (S)Capital intensiveness

Price ceiling: !P !Q !TR
Price Floor: P !Q ?TR
Quota: P !Q ?TR !S

## Per-unit tax (PQ[1], Elasticity & TR[3], TRType & Change[2], Burden[2])
P !Q 

TR including tax
Ed > 1 increase
Ed = 1 unchanged
Ed < 1 decrease

TR excluding tax decrease

C / P

## Subsidy (PQ[1], Elasticity & TR[3], TRType & Change[2], Burden[2])
!P Q

TR excluding subsidy
Ed > 1 decrease
Ed = 1 unchanged
Ed < 1 increase

TR including subsidy increase

P / C

## Burden relationship with elasticity (Comparison [1//3], Extreme [2], Equation[1])
Ed > Es : P > C
Ed = 0 : C | P
Es = Inf : P | S
P/C=Ed/Es

## Inputs (4,4)
Land - rent
Capital - interest
Labour - wage
Entrepreneurship - profit

## Division of labour (3)
Simple - produce good
Complex - produce stage
Regional

## Advantages and disadvantages (2,3)
Practice makes perfect
Save time on training and job rotation

Work becomes monotonous and boring
Higher risk of unemployment
Excessive standardization

## Types of production (3)
Primary - raw materials
Secondary - Finished products, producer goods
Tertiary - services

## Classification of goods (2,3)
Rivalry in consumption - reduce amount available to others 
excludability in consumption - ability to prevent others to use at affordable cost

## Labour: Q & productivity (1,1,3,3)
Q of labour = QT
Size of population
Proportion of working population
Number of working hours

Productivity of labour = U/QT
Education & training
working environment
rewards & benefits to workers

## Labour: payment system (2,4,3) //,,..
Time rate
Piece rate

Labour productivity
Cost to calculate wage
Cost of supervising against shirk
Shared business risk

Wage stability
Increase income by working harder
Shared business risk

## Entrepreneurship (3)
Risk bearing
Decision making
Coordinating and managing production

## Mobility (2)  
Occupational - job rotation
Geographical - place to place


## Total, average, marginal product formula (4)
Q*AP, Sum of MP
TP / Q
Change in TP by increase in varFactor

>> Law of diminishing marginal returns:
In the short run, holding tech constant
When more varFactors are added to a given Q of fixFactor
MP would eventually decrease

>> LoDM answering:
Production is short run with fixFactor and varFactor.
Production illustrates the law because law applies when the unit of varFactors is employed, MP drops from . to .

## Economies of scale (effect[1], reason[3])
production scale != average cost

Larger discounts given to bulk purchase of inputs
Better credibility results in lower interest rate
Marketing expenses are spread over increase output

## Types of market (2)
Product market, goods services
Factor market, factors of production

## Types of exchange (2)
Barter, good - good
Monetary, money medium of exchange good service

## Reasons why a market isn't perfect competition (3)
Imperfect info
Sellers provide heterogeneous services
Non-price competition exists

## Monopoly features (3)
Sellers are price searchers
there is only one seller
Entry to market is restricted
