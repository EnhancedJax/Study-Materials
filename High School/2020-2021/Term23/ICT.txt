Components: Arithmetic & logic unit, control unit, registers
ALU: Performs logical operations 
CU: Keeps track of the sequence of instructions being processed :
Registers: Provide storage space for ALU CU

.Generate purpose registers:
Accumulator, Base register, Counter, Data register ABCDX
Add + Sub = Div /

.Control registers:
Instructive register, instructive to execute by CPU
Program counter, memory address of next instructive
Memory address register, address of memory location to be transferred
Memory data register, data to be written / read from location

.System Bus:
Physical wiring that connects the components of computer sys
Data bus - transfer data and instructions
address bus - transfer source address or destination address
control bus - indicate direction of data transfer and coordinate the timing

.Machine cycle:
Fetch - read next instruction
Decode - identify operation code
execute - perform operation
interrupts - check for and handle interrupts, CPu saves process status and handles interrupt, then resume operation of next instruction

.CPU speed:
1 Hz = 1 clock cycle / sec
Time to complete operation = Clock cycles / frequency
Word length: Number of bits of data and instructions the CPu can handle at one time

.Main memory:
RAM - volatile, high access speed
ROM - non-volatile, bootstrap program & BIOS
Flash memory - read and written at high speeds
Cache memory - high-speed memory storing data and instructions used recently
