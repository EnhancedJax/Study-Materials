Relative price of higher-priced goods in terms of lower-priced goods decreases.
People would consume more HP goods relative to LP goods.
The proportion of HP goods consumed (ratio of HP goods sold to LP goods
sold) would increase.

Allocative function: Resources are allocated according to change in relative price -> more resources allocated to produce good with higher relative price
Signal function: Prices help transmit info about consumer's demand of good relative to producer's supply
