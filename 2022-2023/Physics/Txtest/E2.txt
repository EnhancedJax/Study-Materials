Elastic collision: KE conserved
Inelastic collision: KE not conserved

Impulse: p = Ft
Average force during collision: F = p / t

w = 2pir/t

deriving acceleration of circular motion:
1. draw vector
2. theta -> 0, dtheta = dv / v
3. dtheta = wdt
4. dv/dt = v^2/r

Why does an object move with circular motion: Resultant force acts perpendicularly to the direction of motion to constantly change the direction

Vertical circular motion: 
* F Top: T + W
* F Bot: T - W
* F is resultant force of T and W

Electric field strength unit: NC-1

Particle interaction V = k Q/r

# Drawing field lines:
1. Current + -> -
2. Straight 
3. Evenly spaced 

# Explain field direction
1. + -> away from
2. - -> towards
3. Vectors

What emission: thermionic, e- in heated metal gain energy and leave surface
# Electron guns
1. hot metal surface causes emission of electrons
2. Anode's +ve charge accelerates e

# Capacitor function
* Stores energy
* Total charge = 0
* Separates charge
C = Q / V = It / IR

# Explain capacitor charge with e- flow
* e move from one plate to another through external circuit
* As capacitor charge, rate of flow of e v
* Fully charged, equal amounts of e stored on each plate

Capacitor charging: t = tc, QV .63 0
Capacitor discharging: t = tc, IQV .37 0
Charging curves: I down VQ up
Discharing curves: All down
I-t graph area under: Total charge

m flux density (B T) measure of strength of m field
Is B a vector? Yes
m flux (Phi Wb) describes magnetic field lines passing through a given area

LHR: FBI
Grip rule: Thumb B grip I

For negative charge in magnetic field, current flows in opposite direction relative to its movement

EMF is induced when lines of magnetic field cut through coil
Current is induced when coil forms a complete circuit

# Lenz's law
Direction of induced current is such as to oppose the motion causing it
# Faraday's law
Magnitude of induced emf = rate of change of flux linkage
Average induced emf: time for max V

# Demonstrating Lenz's law
> for magnet falling through coil of wire, coil > free
1. magnet -> coil, dPhi through coil -> induced e I (complete circuit)
2. Due to Lenz's law, same pole induced to the pole of magnet approaching coil -> repulsion force slowing down
3. magnet @ coil, dPhi = 0 -> no induced
4. magnet <- coil, dPhi through coil -> induced e I in opposite direction
5. Due to Lenz's law, opposite pole induced to the pole of magnet leaving coil -> attraction force slowing down

Graph:
- Magnitude of 2nd peak > 1st peak due to magnet at a higher velocity causing rate of change of flux to be greater
- Area under the graph is change of flux linkage

Work done due to Lenz's law: W = Fd so movement caused by Lenz's law does work

# Transformer
1. AC provides alternating current
2. AC -> varying magnetic field in core
3. dPhi through 2nd coil -> induced emf and I (complete circuit)
4. Diode converts AC -> DC

AC Generator: induces EMF and current to coil and hence RHR
DC Motor: exerts magnetic force onto coil and hence LHR

Mass number = p + n
Mass number also called: 
Atomic number = p
alpha particle: 4 2 He+
beta particle: 0 -1
gamma ray: 0 0

# Nuclear model of atom
Experiment: Alpha particle scattering, disprove plum-pudding model
1. most no delfection       -> mostly empty space   ✖ atom matter spread out
2. small deflected          -> center is charged    ✔ no conc. charge
3. very small deflect > 90  -> center is very dense ✔ no conc. mass

Why lead box: Lead absorbs e travelling in directions other than towards foil
Why thin layer: fewer layers of gold, which would absorb the alpha particle

Formula to deduce closest length between charged: W / Q = k Q / d

# Particle accelerators
> LINAC explaination
1. E    E field in gaps -> exert F -> acc.
2. osc  In tube pd reverse
3. pd   Adj tubes have opposite pd
> Why increase length LINAC
1. E field accelerate particle across gap
2. Particle speed constant in tube
3. pd oscillate at constant Hz -> time in gaps & tubes constant
4. Particles enter gap & tutbe with v^, s=vt so gap & tubes length ^
> LINAC collisions
* p starting / end conserved
- Stationary: p > 0
- oppo colli: p = 0

> Cyclotron explaination
1. E    E field in dees -> exert F -> acc. -> p ^ -> r ^
2. osc  In dee pd reverse
3. M    M field perp. cyclotron -> exert centripetal F -> circlar motion
> Why t needed particles cyclotron
1. v independent of t
2. time in dees constant
3. pd oscillate at constant Hz
4. As pd across gap is in correct direction to accelerate particles each time they pass

Find momentum by n of passes: E = Efield x d x Q

# Why high energy particles used to investigate structures
E^ p^ λv, wavelength needs to be comparable to nucleon size

# Generation of mass
Produce: Pair production
Destroy: Annihilation

# Relativistic 
> Lifetime
1. Initial distance propto speed
2. v -> c, v almost const., t stationary > predicted due to rel. incre.
3. Particle travels further as lifetime extended

# Standard model of elementary particles
Hadrons - Formed by quarks
Leptons - Fundamental
Anti particle - same m, equal but opposite Q & Number

Memorisation: up charm strange top 2/3 -1/3 eut -1 neutrino, photon 0
What does +2/3 mean: Positive 2/3 charge of e
Prediction: Symmetry of model, n of quarks = n of leptons

3 quarks forms baryons
another formed by quark: 2 opposite quark -> mesons

# Particle interactions
Conserved quantites:
- EQp
- Baryon number (1, -1, 0)
- Lepton number (1, -1 ,0)

> Energy and momentum conservation
* E = mc^2
* mass energy conserved
* vector momentum diagram
* componnents equal
Assumption:
- No external forces act

lambda = hc \ E
