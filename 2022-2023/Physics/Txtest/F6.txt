Electric field strength unit: NC-1

Particle interaction V = k Q/r

# Drawing field lines:
1. Current + -> -
2. Straight 
3. Evenly spaced 

# Explain field direction
1. + -> away from
2. - -> towards
3. Vectors

# Electron guns
1. hot metal surface causes emission of electrons
2. Anode's +ve charge accelerates e

Capacitor resistance = 0

# Explain capacitor charge with e- flow
* e move from one plate to another through external circuit
* As capacitor charge, rate of flow of e v
* Fully charged, equal amounts of e stored on each plate

Capacitor charging: t = tc, IQV .37 0
Capacitor discharing: t = tc, QV .63 0
Charging curves: I down VQ up
Discharing curves: All down
I-t graph area under: Total charge

Magnetic poles always exists with both NS
N -> S
S -> N if center

m flux density (B T) measure of strength of m field
m flux (Phi Wb) describes magnetic field lines passing through a given area

LHR: FBI
Grip rule: Thumb B grip I

For negative charge in magnetic field, current flows in opposite direction relative to its movement

EMF is induced when lines of magnetic field cut through coil
Current is induced when coil forms a complete circuit

# Lenz's law
Direction of induced current is such as to oppose the motion causing it
# Faraday's law
Magnitude of induced emf = rate of change of flux linkage

# Demonstrating Lenz's law
> for magnet falling through coil of wire, coil > free
1. magnet -> coil, dPhi through coil -> induced e I
2. Due to Lenz's law, same pole induced to the pole of magnet approaching coil -> repulsion force slowing down
3. magnet @ coil, dPhi = 0 -> no induced
4. magnet <- coil, dPhi through coil -> induced e I in opposite direction
5. Due to Lenz's law, opposite pole induced to the pole of magnet leaving coil -> attraction force slowing down

Graph:
- Magnitude of 2nd peak > 1st peak due to magnet at a higher velocity causing rate of change of flux to be greater
- Area under the graph is change of flux linkage

Work done due to Lenz's law: W = Fd so movement caused by Lenz's law does work

AC Generator: induces EMF and current to coil and hence RHR
DC Motor: exerts magnetic force onto coil and hence LHR

alpha particle: 4 2 He+

Plum pudding model: Uniform +ve charge sphere with -ve e-

# Nuclear model of atom
Experiment: Alpha particle scattering
1. most no delfection -> mostly empty space
2. small deflected -> center is +ve charge
3. very small deflect > 90 -> center is very dense

# Particle accelerators
> Linear acceleration process
1. E field accelerate particle across gap
2. Particle speed constant in tube
3. pd alternate at constant Hz -> time in gaps & tubes constant
4. Particles enter gap & tutbe with v^, so gap & tubes length ^

# Bubble chambers:
* Larger radius: greater p
* Curve away from track: Induced particle interact with particle in liquid
* Pair of lines from nowhere: Pair production

# Generation of mass
Conserved quantities: EQp

# Relativistic lifetime
1. Initial distance propto speed
2. At speeds approaching c, lifetime observed stationarily > predicted lifetime due to relativistic increase
3. Particle travels further as lifetime extended

# Standard model of elementary particles
Hadrons - Formed by quarks
Leptons - Fundimental
Fundemental - Cannot be broken down further

Memorisation: up charm strange top 2/3 -1/3 eut -1 neutrino, photon 0

3 quarks forms baryons
