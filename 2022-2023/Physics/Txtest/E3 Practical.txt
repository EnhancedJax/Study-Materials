# Criticizing data 
1. sf 
2. increment
3. set
4. range
5. Rpt mean / only mean
6. unit

# Discuss whether graph supports suggested equation / test relationship
1. Rearrange & compare equation to y=mx+c
2. Identify gradient
3. calc gradient from graph and compare

# Measurement
Calculating mean: remove +-0.2 
% uncertainty measurement: res/2/val
% uncertainty mean value: (max-min)/2/val

Stationary length apparatuses:
- Meter rule 1mm
- Digital calipers 0.1mm
- Micrometer 0.01mm

# Common questions
## Conducting measurements
Graphical method: 
1. Measure var using md
2. Rpt for same value and calc mean
3. Rpt for > 5 sets of results
4. Keep other vars constant
5. Plot graph to check straight line
Accurate oscillation msumt.: 
1. Use timing marker at center
2. Start timing after a few osc
3. Measure multiple osc / n                     -> reduce %U
4. Rpt mean                                     -> reduce random error
Accurate perpendicular dist. msumt.: 
* Meter rule + set square
* Read value perp.                              -> reduce parallax error
Accurate length msumt. techniques: 
* Check for zero error                          -> reduce systematic error
* Rpt at diff pos to find mean                  -> reduce random error
Accurate temp. msumt.: 
* Place thermometer close to source
* Stir water
## Measuring accuracy
Why light gate:
* Remove reaction time
* Remove parallax error as in fixed position
Why data logger: Many readings can be taken simultaneously in a short time
Why motion camera: 
* Helps with judging time when rotation is completed
* Helps with viewing motion slowly
## Uncertainty
Why reduce % uncertainty: 
* Uncertainty in md constant
* Larger measurement -> lower %U
Why the uncertainty in … is …: 
1. U of single measurement = 1/2 the resolution of md
2. U% = U1% * n

# Experiments
> Emission of radiation investigations
Setup
1. Ensure source and detector in line
2. Measure d with meter rule
3. Rpt mean
4. Measure & subtract bg count
5. Plot graph
Precaution
1. Handle with long tongs
2. Keep distance from source
Why measure bg count: Subtract from measured count as systematic error

> Capacitor investigations
Precaution
* Ensure capacitor fully discharged
Determine capacitance
1. Choose val of resistor -> reasonable discharge time
2. Measure R of resistor by multimeter
3. Charge capacitors -> initial p.d.
4. Start stopwatch while flipping the switch
5. Plot I-t graph -> t when I@.37
6. t=RC

> Specific latent heat investigations
Setup
1. Power supply, Jmeter
Determine L
*  Wait until water boils
1. Record values of m to E with Jmeter
2. Plot m-E graph 
3. Gradient = 1/L
Source of errors
1. Water moving
2. Heat lost to surroundings
