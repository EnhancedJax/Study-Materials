# Criticizing data 
1. sf 
2. increment
3. set
4. range
5. Rpt mean / only mean
6. unit

# Discuss whether graph supports suggested equation / test relationship
1. Rearrange & compare equation to y=mx+c
2. Identify gradient
3. calc gradient from graph and compare

# Measurement
Calculating mean: remove +-0.2 
% uncertainty measurement: res/2/val
% uncertainty mean value: (max-min)/2/val

Stationary length apparatuses:
- Meter rule 1mm
- Digital calipers 0.1mm
- Micrometer 0.01mm

# Common questions
## Conducting measurements
Graphical method: 
1. Measure var using md
2. Rpt for same value and calc mean
3. Rpt for > 5 sets of results
4. Keep other vars constant
5. Plot graph to check straight line
Accurate oscillation msumt.: 
1. Measure multiple osc / n                     -> reduce %U
2. Rpt mean                                     -> reduce random error
3. Use timing marker at center
4. Start timing after a few rotations
Accurate perpendicular dist. msumt.: 
* Meter rule + set square
* Read value perp.                              -> reduce parallax error
Accurate length msumt. techniques: 
* Check for zero error                          -> reduce systematic error
* Rpt at diff pos to find mean                  -> reduce random error
• Accurate temp. msumt.: 
* Place thermometer close to source
* Stir water
## Measuring accuracy
Why light gate:
* Remove reaction time
* Remove parallax error as in fixed position
Why data logger: Many readings can be taken simultaneously in a short time
Why motion camera: 
* Helps with judging time when rotation is completed
* Helps with viewing motion slowly
## Uncertainty
Why reduce % uncertainty: 
* Uncertainty in md constant
* Larger measurement -> lower %U
Why the uncertainty in … is …: 
1. U of single measurement = 1/2 the resolution of md
2. U% = U1% * n

# Experiments
> Emission of radiation investigations
Setup
1. Measure bg count
2. Ensure source and detector in line
3. Measure d with meter rule
4. Rpt measure count then find mean
5. Subtract bg count
6. Plot graph
Precaution
1. Handle source with long tongs
2. Maintain distance from source when use
Why measure bg count: Subtract from measured count as systematic error

> Capacitor investigations
Setup
1. Capacitor connected to power supply
2. Circuit to discharge capacitor through A & R
3. Switch
Precaution
* Ensure capacitor fully discharged
Determine capacitance
1. Choose the value of resistor -> reasonable discharge time
2. Measure the R of the resistor using a multimeter
3. Charge the capacitors to the initial p.d.
4. Start the stopwatch at the same time as changing the switch
5. Plot I-t graph, find time for I to fall to 37%
6. t=RC

> Specific latent heat investigations
Setup
1. Power supply, Jmeter
Determine L
1. Wait until water boils
2. Record values of m to E with Jmeter
3. Plot m-E graph 
4. Gradient is 1/L
Source of errors
1. Water moving
2. Heat lost to surroundings
