# Average KE per molecule
* Eq shows that for same T, avg KE per molecule is same of any molecule
* During change of state, PE changes
* During change of state, T remains constant
* Internal energy = KE + PE

# Why does increasing temperature increase the pressure?
1. avg KE inc
2. v inc
3. f inc
4. state var unchanged
5. d(momentum)/dt inc
6. F on wall inc
7. p = F / A

# Ideal gas assumptions
1. Negligible size
2. Identical
3. Exert no F on each other

Moleucles in ideal has no PE

Beta	0,-1b	Few mm Al
Gamma	0,0y	Few mm Sn

## Trend of properties
1. Ionisation dec ~ dmg
2. Range inc

Activity	        - The rate of decay of nuclei
Random decay	    - Can't predict which nucelus decays next
Half life	        - Avg time for A to halve
Binding E	        - E required to split nuclues into its separate molecules

## Why can't use activity to determine age
* Time scale too lone, A -> 0

## Measuring count rate
* n particles propto distance
* bg radiation inc reading
* Longer t reduces uncertainy of random decay

# Fission & fusion
Fission             - Large nucleus splits into smaller fragments
Mass deficit = p + n - a - e
## cont. fusion -> ^ E released
* Mass -> E by E=mc2 where m = mass lost
* High rate compensates E / fusion
## Fission fragments <-> move away
* Initial momentum 0, must be conserved

Fe is the most stable element as smallest m/n

## Fission only for big nuclei
* Split massive nucleus inc BE -> release E
* Split light nucleus requires E as m/n dec -> release E
## Big fission -> ^ E released
* Split massive nucleus inc BE -> release E
* Large number of fragment nucleons => large total E release

# Fusion as power supply
## Advantages
1. Unlimited fuel supply
2. Hardly any radioactive waste
## Disadvantages / facts
* High T needed -> nuclei enough KE to overcome electrostatic repulsion -> get close
* High densities needed -> high enough collision rate
> Reaction must be contained securely + strong B field
> Material touches container -> T dec
> Stars are ideal as great G-force

# SHM conditions
1. F acting towards eq pos

## Energy
GPE of bob osc = 1/2kx2

# Resonance
System forced into osc at natural f -> max E transfer -> A inc

# Damping 
Reduction in E from osc sys due to resistive F -> A dec
* What materials necessary for energy dissipation to be effective: Plastic
> Because: Shape changes & doesn't return -> E not returned to sys

# Star classifications
Main sequence stars	  - Stars that fuses H2 in core
## White dwarfs
* The core remnant of red giant stars
* No fusion
* Small surface area, not very luminous
* Very hot, appear white
## H-R diagram
Vertical:       L// 10^-4 -> 10^6
Horizontal:     K// 6000K @ sun, x2 / 2
### Age of clusters
Young clusters: Main sequence only
Old clusters:   White dwarfs no giants
## Star properties
Size ^ G-forces ^ rate of fusion ^ T ^
## Life cycle of low mass star
1. Fusion H
2. No buring -> Core T dec -> Size dec
3. Expand in size -> red giant
4. Fusion He
5. No He -> T needed for fusion > T inc
6. White dwarf

# Distance to stars
Parallax               - Change in pos relative to bg
## Determine distance by parallax
1. obj viewed at oppos. ends of d of earth's orbit around sun
2. d anglar pos of star against bg measured
3. trigo used
4. r of earth's orbit <-> sun must be known
## Determine distance by standard candle
1. Standard candle = object of known L
2. Identify obj. sc + measure flux
3. Inverse square law used

# Age of universe
Redshift                - The fractional wavelength inc due to source moving away from observer
## How does doppler shift prove the expansion of the universe?
1. z=v/c -> calc v
2. Galaxies were moving away from Earth
3. Further ~ faster
4. Galaxies moving away from each other
## Why λ of light detected from orbiting bodies change?
1. Doppler shift
2. Object moving away & towards observer
3. Towards dec away inc
## Determine distance to distant galaxies
1. Measure λ of line in spectrum
2. Find diff of λ of same line in lab
3. z=v/c -> galaxy v
4. Hubble’s law -> distance
## Feasibility
Parallax:           nS
Standard candle:    @S + nG
Redshift:           dG
* Standard candle can't as flux is too small for measurement

# Fate of everything
Critical density        - Density of matter in uni below which uni expand forever
Dark matter		        - Matter that can’t be detected via em-interaction which has mass
## What is concluded from the observation of difference in values of observed mass & actual mass?
* There is matter that doesn’t emit or absorb em-radiation
* So dark matter must be present
## How does dark matter relate to the fate of the universe?
* Dark matter increases density
* Fate depends upon density, compared with cd
## Critical density
