# Average KE per molecule
* Eq shows that for same T, avg KE per molecule is same of any molecule
* During change of state, PE changes
* During change of state, T remains constant
* Internal energy = KE + PE

# Why does increasing temperature increase the pressure?
1. v inc
2. f inc
3. state var unchanged
4. d(momentum)/dt inc
5. F on wall inc

# Ideal gas assumptions
1. Negligible size
2. Identical
3. Exert no F on each other

Moleucles in ideal has no PE

1. Ionisation dec ~ dmg
2. Range inc

Activity	    - The rate of decay of nuclei
Random decay	- Can't predict which nucelus decays next
Half life	    - Avg time taken for activity to halve
Binding E	    - E required to split nuclues into its separate molecules

## Why can't use activity to determine age
* Time scale too lone, activity -> 0

## Measuring count rate
* n particles propto distance
* Background radiation increases reading
* Longer t reduces uncertainy of decay's random nature

# Fission & fusion
## Why does continous fusion release large amounts of E?
* Mass -> E by E=mc2 where m = mass lost
* High fusion rate compensates E per fusion
## Why does fragments of fission move away from each pother
* Initial momentum 0, must be conserved

Fe is the most stable element as smallest m/n

## Why nuclear fission is only possible for massive nuclei?
* Split massive nucleus ^ BE -> release E
* Split light nucleus requires E as m/n dec -> release E
## Why does fission of massive nuclei release large amounts of E?
* Split massive nucleus ^ BE -> release E
* Large number of nucleons of fragments means large overall E release

# Fusion as power supply
## Advantages
1. Unlimited fuel supply
2. Hardly any radioactive waste
## Disadvantages / facts
* Higher T -> nuclei KE to overcome electrostatic repulsion -> get close
* High densities needed to give a high enough collision rate
> Reaction must be contained securely along with strong magnetic field
> If material touches container, T dec
> Stars are ideal as great G-force

# SHM conditions
1. F is acting towards eq pos
2. F propto displacement from eq position

# Resonance
System forced into osc system at f0 -> max E transfer -> A inc

# Damping 
Reduction in E from osc system due to resistive F -> A dec
* What materials necessary for energy dissipation to be effective: Plastic

# Star classifications
Main sequence stars	  - Stars that fuses H2 in core
## White dwarfs
* The core remnant of red giant stars
* No fusion
* Small surface area, not very luminous
* Very hot, appear white
## H-R diagram
Vertical:   10^-4 -> 10^6
Horizontal: 2e4 || 1e4 || 6e3 || 2.5e3
### Age of clusters
Lack of giants: young
White dwarf:    old
## Star properties
Size ^ gravitational forces ^ rate of fusion ^ T ^
## Life cycle of low mass star
1. Fusion H
2. No buring -> Core T v
3. Expand in size -> red giant
4. Fusion He
5. No burning -> T ^ < needed for fusion
6. White dwarf

# Distance to stars
Parallax               - Change in position relative to background
Arcsec = Arcdiff/2
d = arcsec-1
## Determine distance by parallax
1. Object viewed at opposite ends of earth
2. Change in angular positions of star against background measured
3. Trigo used
4. r of Earth’s orbit <-> sun must be known
## Determine distance by standard candle
1. Standard candle = object of known luminosity
2. Identify object standard candle + measure flux
3. Inverse square law used

# Age of universe
## How does doppler shift prove the expansion of the universe?
1. z=v/c to calc v
2. Galaxies were moving away from Earth
3. Further ~ faster
4. Galaxies moving away from each other
## Why λ of light detected from orbiting bodies change?
1. Doppler shift
2. Object moving towards & away from observer
3. Approaching v leaving ^
## Determine distance to distant galaxies
1. Measure λ of line in spectrum by distant galaxy
2. Determine difference of λ of same line in lab
3. Use z=v/c -> velocity of galaxy
4. Hubble’s law -> distance
## Feasibility
Parallax:           Nearby stars
Standard candle:    Any stars & Nearby galaxies
Redshift:           Distant galaxies
* Standard candle can't as flux is too small for measurement

# Fate of everything
Critical density    - Density of matter in the Universe, below which universe will expand forever
Dark matter		    - Matter that can’t be detected via em-interaction which has mass
## What is concluded from the observation of difference in values of observed mass & actual mass?
* There is matter that doesn’t emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation
* So dark matter must be present
## How does dark matter relate to the fate of the universe?
* Dark matter increases density
* Fate depends upon density, compared with a critical density value
## Critical density
