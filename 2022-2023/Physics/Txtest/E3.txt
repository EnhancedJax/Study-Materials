# Average KE per molecule
* Equation shows that for same T, average KE per molecule is same of any molecule
* During change of state, PE changes
* During change of state, T remains constant
* Internal energy = KE + PE

# Why does increasing temperature increase the pressure?
1. Atoms moves faster
2. More frequent collisions
3. State variables that are unchanged 
4. Rate of change of momentum is greater
5. Larger force on walls

# Ideal gas assumptions
1. Negligible size
2. Identical
3. Exert no force on each other

Moleucles in ideal has no PE

# Particles
P | C | Pentrating power
Alpha	4,2a	Paper
Beta	0,-1a	Few mm Al
Gamma	0,0y	Few mm Sn

## Trend of properties
1. Ionisation decrease propto damage
2. Range increase
3. Penetrating power increase

Activity	    - The rate of decay of nuclei
Random decay	- Can't preduce which nucelus decays next
Half life	    - Avg time taken for activity to halve
Binding E	    - E required to split nuclues into its separate molecules

## Why can't use activity to determine age
* Time scale too lone, activity -> 0

## Measuring count rate
* nparticles propto distance
* Background radiation increases reading
* Longer time reduces uncertainy of decay's random nature

# Fission & fusion
## Why does continous fusion release large amounts of E?
* Mass -> E by E=mc2 where m = mass lost
* High fusion rate compensates E per fusion
## Why does fragments of fission move away from each pother
* Initial momentum 0, must be conserved

Fe is the most stable element as smallest mass per nucleon

## Why nuclear fission is only possible for massive nuclei?
* Splitting of massive nucleus ^ BE -> release E
* Splitting of light nucleus requires E as mass per nucleus v -> release E
## Why does fission of massive nuclei release large amounts of E?
* Splitting of massive nucleus ^ BE -> release E
* Large number of nucleons of fragments means large overall E release

# Fusion as power supply
## Advantages
1. Unlimited fuel supply
2. Hardly any radioactive waste
## Disadvantages / facts
* Higher temperatures needed to give nuclei enough KE to overcome electrostatic repulsion to come near
* High densities needed to give a high enough collision rate
> Reaction must be contained securely along with strong magnetic field
> If material touches container, temperature decreases
> Stars are ideal for fusion as great G-force

# SHM conditions
1. F is acting towards eq pos
2. F propto displacement from eq position

# d-t
v-t: lambda/4
a-t: lambda/2

# Resonance
System forced into oscillation at f0 resulting in max E transfer -> A ^

# Damping 
Reduction in E from an oscillation due to resistive F on the oscillating system leading to decrease in A
* What materials necessary for energy dissipation to be effective: Plastic
> They change shape and doesn't return to original shape, so energy is not returned to system

# Star classifications
Main sequence stars	  - Stars that fuses H2 in core
## White dwarfs
* The core remnant of red giant stars
* No fusion
* Small surface area, not very luminous
* Very hot, appear white
## H-R diagram
Vertical:   10^-4 -> 10^6
Horizontal: 2e4 || 1e4 || 6e3 || 2.5e3
### Age of clusters
Lack of giants: young
White dwarf:    old
## Star properties
Size ^ gravitational forces ^ rate of fusion ^ T ^
## Life cycle of low mass star
1. Fusion H
2. No buring -> Core T v
3. Expand in size -> red giant
4. Fusion He
5. No burning -> T ^ < needed for fusion
6. White dwarf

# Distance to stars
Parallax               - Change in position relative to background
## Determine distance by parallax
1. Object viewed at opposite ends of earth
2. Change in angular positions of star against background measured
3. Trigonometry used
4. Radius of Earth’s orbit to the sun must be known
## Determine distance by standard candle
1. Standard candle – object of known luminosity
2. Identify object standard candle and F measured
3. Inverse square law used

# Age of universe
## How does doppler shift prove the expansion of the universe?
1. z=v/c to calc v
2. Galaxies were moving away from Earth
3. The further the galaxy the faster they move away
4. Galaxies hence are moving away from each other
## Why wavelength of light detected from orbiting bodies change?
1. Doppler shift
2. Object moving towards and away from observer
3. Approaching v leaving ^
## Determine distance to distant galaxies
1. Measure λ of line in spectrum by distant galaxy
2. Determine difference of λ of same line in lab
3. Use z=v/c -> velocity of galaxy
4. Hubble’s law -> distance
## Feasibility
Parallax:           Nearby stars
Standard candle:    Any stars & Nearby galaxies
Redshift:           Distant galaxies
* Standard candle can't as flux is too small for measurement

# Fate of everything
Critical density    - Density of matter in the Universe, below which universe will expand forever
Dark matter		    - Matter that can’t be detected via em-interaction by has mass
## What is concluded from the observation of difference in values of observed mass & actual mass?
* There must matter that doesn’t emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation
* So dark matter must be present
## How does dark matter relate to the fate of the universe?
* Dark matter increases density
* Fate depends upon density, compared with a critical density value
## Critical density
