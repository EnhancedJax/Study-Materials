# Criticizing data 
1. sf 
2. increment
3. set
4. range
5. repeat mean

# Measurement
Calculating mean: remove +-0.2 

Stationary length apparatuses:
- Meter rule 1mm
- Digital calipers 0.1mm
- Micrometer 0.01mm

Distance between movements: Video camera, m device, same pos
Measuring temp for water bath: measure t of water

Voltage:      Voltmeter parallel to electrical component 
Current:      Ammeter in series 

## Measuring methods 
Radius:     diameter / 2

## Common questions
Why measuring device suitable: Much less resolution compared to measurement, low % uncertainty   
Accurate length measurement:   
1. Suitable measuring device 
2. Suitable readings in different positions
3. Ensure measurement at widest point 
4. Take mean 
Determining value by measurements
1. Use a suitable device 
2. Measure related variables 
3. Use correct formula 
4. Repeat to find mean 

## Common uncertainties 
Zero error: Subtract y-var with value of error 
Parallax error: Ensure measuring device is at eye-level 
Uncertain position: Repeat and calculate mean value 

Using light gates to determine velocity:
1. Measure length of moving object 
2. v = length / time

# Experiments 
> Extension of spring
- Fixed support
- Spring
- Mass
1. Measure initial length & length with load, subtract → extension 
2. Measuring device: Ruler ensured eye-level to reduce parallax 
3. Different masses for different values 

> Light beam
-> denser, bend -> normal, v increase
-> less dense, bend <- normal, v decrease
i = C, r = 90

Why monochromatic light: Single lambda, more accurate measurement of r, range of lambda -> range of r

> Circuits – Electrical component properties 
Setup 
1. Variable power supply / resistor 
2. Ammeter in series 
3. Voltmeter connected in parallel with electrical component 

# Essential knowledge 
> Unit 1 
Friction can only be actively measured when v =/= 0

> Unit 2 
Net force formula: W = U + D
Upthrust = vol * p * g

**F-Δx graph**
• The area under the graph is elastic strain energy
• The slope of the graph k
• The area between loading and unload lines is the work done → permanently deform 

> Unit 3 
E = hc / lambda
Only waves can show Interference and Diffraction 
The angle of incidence and refraction are taken from the normal 

**Interference**
• Constructive - whole number wavelength difference - in phase 
• Destructive - 0.5 wavelength difference - out of phase 

Total internal reflection 
i > Critical -> less dense

> Unit 4 
**Distribution of current in circuits**
Series: 
- I Constant
- Sum of pd = emf
Parallel
- Sum I in all branches = total
- V in all branches same
