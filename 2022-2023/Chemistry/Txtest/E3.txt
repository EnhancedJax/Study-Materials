Unit 16
============================================================

Disproportionation reaction     - Elements of the same compound undergoes both oxidation and reduction
Standard electrode potential    - Potentials measured against standard hydrogen electrode at standard conditions
Standard conditions             - 100kPa, 298K, 1 mol dm-3

Large E: Reduced, stronger oxidizing
If formula both element aq:
* Electrode: Pt
* Solution: Both

Electrolytes must be: Soluble (Nitrates)

Electrocell diagram LR: Oxidized -> Reduced

Shorthand: S1 | S1 Oxi || S2 | S2 Red

Ecell propto lnK
Kinetically stable				- Ea large
Thermodynamically stable		- Ecell > 0

# Fuel cells
Overall: 2H2 + O2 -> H2O (same Ecell)
Membrane: Separates H2 O2 gases
Electrodes coated: Pt as catalyst
Alkaline / acid function: Electrolytes

## Formula commons
Anode (-): H2 -> 2e-
Cathode (+): O2 + 4e- -> 
Acidic: add H+
Alkaline: add OH-

### Advantages
1. Env friendly
2. No harmful product
3. Alternative fossil
### Disadvantages
1. H2 flammable
2. H2 not renewable
3. H2 storage hazard / cost

# Titrations
Common color change: MnO4- -> Mn2+
Color change: purple -> pale pink
Acidic conditions are used: prevent formation of MnO2 brown pp

============================================================

Transitional metals     - Metals that can form > 0 stable ions with partially filled d subshell
Co-ordination number    - Number of c.o bonds
Multidentate ligands    - Ligands that has > 1 lone pair of e- that can bond to t.m. ion

Electronic configuration differences: More stability for half-filled subshells, so 4s1x / 3d5,10

Large ligands + shape: Cl- 4 tetrahedral
Small ligands + shape: H2O NH3 6 Octahedral

Reason for number of ligands around t.m.:
1. Ligands repel each other as far as possible
2. Giving shape with bond angles of X

### Naming
H2O: Aqua
NH3: Ammine
X: Halo
OH-: Hydroxo

# Isomerism
2 sets:
1. Optical 3-bi
2. Geometric 4x2 octahedral / 2x2 square planar

cis - same side | trans - opposite side

# Reactions and colors

## Colors
1.	Partially filled d-orbital
2.	Ligands -> d-d splitting
3.	Visible spectrum radiation absorbed
4.	Light -> d-d transitions
5.	Complementary color observed 

## Reaction types
1. Deprotonation	    Ligands ± H+
2. Ligand exchange	    Ligands replaced
3. Redox		        Δ Oxidation number
4. C.o. number change 	Δ Number of ligands in complex 

## Reaction table
### Color & reaction table
* V color small to big: Purple Green Blue Yellow
* Cu+ shake turns to Cu2+ due to oxidation by O2
* Fe upon standing turns from +2 to +3

# Heterogeneous catalyst Mechanism
* Provide alternative reaction pathway with lower Ea
* Different phase
1. R adsorb onto surface
2. Weakens bond in R
3. Products then desorb

## Contact process
2SO2 + O2 <=> 2SO3
### Mechanism
* V2O5 [5->4] w/ SO2
* V2O4 [4->5] w/ O2
## Haber process mechanism
Pt [4->5]

# Disproving Kekule structure of Arene
1. dH of reaction w/ H2 less than expected
2. CC bond same length
3. Br water not decolorsied
## Explaination
1. Delocalization of pi e -> more stable
2. Substitution instead of addition occurs -> maintain stable [3]

# Explaination of reaction speeds
Alkylarene: alkyl group donates e to ring -> stronger nucleophile
Phenol:
1. OH group attached to ring
2. O lone pair of e- overlaps with pi cloud -> donated to the ring
3. e- density of ring increase

# Arene reactions
For [H2SO4, HNO3, <30C] HNO3 -> +H2O:
Low temperature as: Prevent further substitution

Phenol bromination: [room temp] ArOH + 3Br2 -> ArOHBr3 + 3HBr (orange -> white pp)

## Mechanism
### Step 1
1. C has partial +ve charge
2. E+ has lone pair e- which moves to C
3. Bond to leftover E part breaks
### Step 2
Arrow direction: From C-H bond to ring as ring is e rich
