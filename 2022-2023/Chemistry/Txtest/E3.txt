Transitional metals     - Metals that can form > 0 stable ions with partially filled d subshell
Co-ordination number    - Number of c.o bonds
Multidentate ligands    - Ligands that has > 1 lone pair of e- that can bond to t.m. ion

Electronic configuration differences: More stability for half-filled subshells, so 4s2 / 3d5,10

Large ligands + shape: Cl- 4 tetrahedral
Small ligands + shape: H2O NH3 6 Octahedral

Reason for number of ligands around t.m.:
1. Ligands repel each other as far as possible
2. Giving shape with bond angles of X

### Naming
H2O: Aqua
NH3: Ammine
X: Halo
OH-: Hydroxo

# Isomerism
2 sets:
1. Optical 3-bi
2. cis-trans Geometric 4x2 octahedral / 2x2 square planar

cis - same side | trans - opposite side

# Disproving Kekule structure of Arene
1. dH of reaction w/ H2 less than expected
2. CC bond same length
3. Br water not decolorsied
## Explaination
1. Delocalization of pi e -> more stable [2]
2. More stable [1,3]
3. Substitution instead of addition occurs -> maintain stable [3]

# Explaination of reaction speeds
Alkylarene: alkyl group donates e- to ring -> stronger nucleophile
Phenol:
1. OH group attached to ring
2. O lone pair of e- overlaps with pi cloud -> donated to the ring
3. e- density of ring increase

# Arene reactions
For [H2SO4, HNO3, <30C] HNO3 -> +H2O:
Low temperature as: Prevent further substitution

Phenol bromination: [room temp] ArOH + 3Br2 -> ArOHBr3 + 3HBr (orange -> white pp)

## Mechanism
Prepare electrophile: EX + AlX3 -> E+ + AlX4-
### Step 1
1. C has partial +ve charge
2. E+ has lone pair e- which moves to C
3. Bond to leftover E part breaks
### Step 2
Arrow direction: From H to ring as ring is e rich
