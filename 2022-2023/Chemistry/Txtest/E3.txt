Unit 16
============================================================

Disproportionation reaction     - Elements of the same compound undergoes both oxidation and reduction
Standard electrode potential    - Potentials measured against standard hydrogen electrode at standard conditions
Standard conditions             - 100kPa, 298K, 1 mol dm-3

Large E: Reduced, stronger oxidizing

Electrolytes must be: Soluble (Nitrates)

Electrocell diagram LR: Oxidized -> Reduced

Shorthand: S1 | S1 Oxi || S2 | S2 Red

dG = -nFEcell = -RTlnK
Ecell propto lnK
Kinetically stable				- Ea large
Thermodynamically stable		- Ecell > 0

# Fuel cells
Overall: 2H2 + O2 -> H2O (same Ecell)
Membrane: Separates H2 O2 gases
Electrodes coated: Pt as catalyst
Alkaline / acid function: Electrolytes

## Formula commons
Anode (-): H2 + ... -> ... + 2e-
Cathode (+): O2 + ... + 4e- -> ...
Acidic: add OH-
Alkaline: add H+

### Advantages
1. Env friendly
2. No harmful product
3. Alternative fossil
### Disadvantages
1. H2 flammable
2. H2 not renewable
3. H2 storage hazard / cost

# Titrations
Common color change: MnO4- -> Mn2+
Color change: purple -> pale pink
Acidic conditions are used: prevent formation of MnO2 brown pp

Also test: Cell drawing, measure electrode drawing, fuel cell diagram

Unit 17
============================================================
Transitional metals     - Metals that can form > 0 stable ions with partially filled d subshell
Co-ordination number    - Number of c.o bonds
Multidentate ligands    - Ligands that has > 1 lone pair of e- that can bond to t.m. ion

Electronic configuration differences: More stability for half-filled subshells, so 4s2 / 3d5,10

Large ligands + shape: Cl- 4 tetrahedral
Small ligands + shape: H2O NH3 6 Octahedral

Reason for number of ligands around t.m.:
1. Ligands repel each other as far as possible
2. Giving shape with bond angles of X

### Naming
H2O: Aqua
NH3: Ammine
X: Halo
OH-: Hydroxo

# Isomerism
2 sets:
1. Optical 3-bi
2. cis-trans Geometric 4x2 octahedral / 2x2 square planar

cis - same side | trans - opposite side

# Reactions and colors

## Colors
1.	Partially filled d-orbital
2.	Ligands cause d-d splitting
3.	Visible spectrum radiation absorbed
4.	Light causes d-d transitions
5.	Complementary color observed 

## Reaction types
1. Deprotonation	    Ligands ± H+
2. Ligand exchange	    Ligands replaced
3. Redox		        Δ Oxidation number
4. C.o. number change 	Δ Number of ligands in complex
