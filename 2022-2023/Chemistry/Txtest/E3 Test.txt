Unit 17
============================================================
Transitional metals     - Metals that can form > 0 stable ions with partially filled d subshell
Co-ordination number    - Number of c.o bonds
Multidentate ligands    - Ligands that has > 1 lone pair of e- that can bond to t.m. ion

Electronic configuration differences: More stability for half-filled subshells, so 4s2 / 3d5,10

Large ligands + shape: Cl- 4 tetrahedral
Small ligands + shape: H2O NH3 6 Octahedral

Reason for number of ligands around t.m.:
1. Ligands repel each other as far as possible
2. Giving shape with bond angles of X

### Naming
H2O: Aqua
NH3: Ammine
X: Halo
OH-: Hydroxo

# Isomerism
2 sets:
1. Optical 3-bi
2. cis-trans Geometric 4x2 octahedral / 2x2 square planar

cis - same side | trans - opposite side

# Reactions and colors

## Colors
1.	Partially filled d-orbital
2.	Ligands cause d-d splitting
3.	Visible spectrum radiation absorbed
4.	Light causes d-d transitions
5.	Complementary color observed 

## Reaction types
1. Deprotonation	    Ligands ± H+
2. Ligand exchange	    Ligands replaced
3. Redox		        Δ Oxidation number
4. C.o. number change 	Δ Number of ligands in complex
