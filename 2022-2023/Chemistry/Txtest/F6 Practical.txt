# Inorganic analysis
> Basic test
H2          Lighted splint pop sound
O2          Relight glowing splint
CO2         Lime water -> milky
H2O         CuSO4 => B
NH3         HCl(g) => White fumes (NH4Cl)
NH4+        NaOH(warm aq) => Gas litmus R B (NH3)
Sulfate     Barium => white pp
Carbonates  HCl => Bubbles (CO2)
Iodine      Starch indicator => Black

> Group 7 test
Method 1: Acidified silver nitrate => White cream yellow pp (HX)
Method 2: conc. H2SO4 => White brown purple fumes (HCl, Br2, I2)

# Organic analysis
> C=C

Method 2: Acidified K2MnO4 => Decolorised
Method 3: Burn => Smoky flame

> Hydroxyl group
Method 1: PCl5 => White fumes (HCl)
Method 2: Na => Bubbles (H2)

> Acids
Method 1: Alchol under acidic solution => Fruity smell
Method 2: Carbonates => Bubbles (CO2)

> Alchol & derivatives
1 / 2 deg: acidified K2Cr2O7 => Orange, Green
aldehydes: Benedict => B, R
CH3C=O:    Warm alkaline sol. I2 => Yellow pp

# Essential knowledge
> Decomposition
Ammonium carbonate:         (NH4)2CO3 -> 2NH3 + H2O + CO2
Metal Carbonates:           MCO3 -> MO + CO2
Metal Hydrogen Carbonates:  2MHCO3 -> M2CO3 + H2O + CO2

Rate of reaction of halogenoalkanes: I > Br > Cl, 3 > 2 > 1

Common drying agent: MgSO4 (Anhydrous, doesn't react)

==================================================================

# Enthalpy change of Rx
ΔH = -mcΔt/n
m = mass of solvent
n = mol of solute

Latter part of temp-time graph: Heat transferred from surrounding to system

> Asumptions
1. Solution density 1gmcm-3
2. Specific heat capacity same as water

> CQ 
ΔH can't be measured directly: Hard to measure temp change of solid, substance might evaporate
Glass beaker effect on ΔH: Glass worse insulator, less exothermic
Lower than accurate value: heat lost to surroundings

# Concentration / purity of solution
Mean titre: +- 0.2

> Preparing standard solutions
1. Dissolve solid in concial flask with distilled water
2. Pour solution into volumetric flask with washings
3. Add water up to the mark & shake

> CQ
Reasons for washing: Ensure all solution is transferred
Why burette rinsed with tirate: Remove remaining water

# Percentage yield of halogenoalkane
Also test: Drawing reflux & distillation

> CQ
* Prepare solution
Slow addition of acid with cooling: Reaction exothermic, prevent boiling over 
* Reflux 
Powdered solid: Increase surface area, faster reaction
Anti-bumping granules: Revent mixtrue from overflowing to condenser
* Separating funnel 
Effervescence: Remove stopper to release built-up pressure 
Species added when running off: Remove excess acid 
Anhydrous species added: Remove water, solution goes clear 
* Final distillation 
Distillate collected in temp range: Only target species boil within this range, above this range others will be collected

# Others
Heating stop, remove delivery tube: Suck-back occurs, lower pressure in test tube, test tube will crack
Obtain dry crystals: Heat to crystallization, leave to crystallize, dry in oven

# Indicators
Methyl orange: ROY
Phenolphthalein: CPR
Litmus paper: RB
