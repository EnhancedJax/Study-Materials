# Essential knowledge
> Decomposition
Ammonium carbonate:      (N4
Metal Carbonates:           
Metal Hydrogen Carbonates:  2MHCO3 = M2Co3 + h2O = co2

Rate of reaction of halogenoalkanes: 

Common drying agent: 

==================================================================

# Enthalpy change of Rx
ΔH = -mcdt\n
m = mass of solvent
n = mol of solute

Latter part of temp-time graph: heat lost to surroundings

> Asumptions
1. 1gcm-3 density
2. 1 spefici heat capacity as water

> CQ 
ΔH can't be measured directly: hard to measure temperature of a solid, solution might evaporate
Glass beaker effect on ΔH: worse insoltaotr, less exothermic
Lower than accurate value: more heat lost to surroundings

# Concentration / purity of solution
Mean titre: +-0.3cm3

> Preparing standard solutions
1. dissolve solution in concial flask with distilled water
2. transfer to volmetric flask with washing
3. make up to 250cm3, stopper and shake

> Titrate
1. prepare solution of known conc.
2. prepare hcl of known conc/
3. titrate against meythl orange
4. repeat until +- 0.2cm3

> CQ
Reasons for washing: ensure compelte transfer
Why burette rinsed with tirate: 

# Percentage yield of halogenoalkane
Also test: Drawing reflux & distillation
