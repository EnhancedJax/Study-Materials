Rate of reaction - Rate of change of conc. of R
Overall order of reaction - Product of powers of all conc. of R in r8 eq

rate & k units are derived

Half life: time for conc. to half from last
[A]-t graph
0: HL unchanged
1: HL x2
1/t-[A]
0: Flat
1: Linear
2: Curved

Rate determining step: Slowest step
R in RDS = R in eq
mol ratio in RDS = order 

Arrhenius Equation: lnk = -Ea/RT + lnA

# Catalyst types
Homogenous: Same phase as R

Heterogeneous: Different phase as R
- Mechanism: Absorption @ surface, reaction, desorption leaving surface
- Advantage: No separation from P needed

Autocatalysis: P as catalyst: [P] ^ Rate ^
- Mechanism: Slow at start, Catalyst P formed speeding up, [R] v reaction slows down

# NS mechanisms
Sn1: degree 3 2
- Mechanism: Nu attack C
- Steps: 2
- Rate eq: Step 1 RDS (slow)
- Fastest: Tertiary RX due to stability of C+

Sn2: degree 1 2
- Mechanism: Nu attacks C with X leaving simutaneously 
- Steps: 1
- Fastest: Primary RX due to ease of access of C attached to X by Nu

# Following rate of reactions
> Titration
1. Remove small samples to measure rate
2. Quench by removing catalyst or icing
3. Titrate with reagent

> Color change
Reactions with aq solutions

> Change of volume of gas
Reactions with gaseous P
Collecting of gas: 
- Over water not applicable: NH3 CO2 dissolves
- With syringe: Higher precision

> Change of mass of gas
Reactions with high density gaseous P

> Electrical conductivity
Reactions with change of n of ions, ions ^ conductivity ^

# Iodine clock reaction
Starch and thiosulfate (S2O3) added
Blue black color formed     - i2 rx starch
2I- reproduced              - i2 rx s2o3
Time to show color is delayed because thiosulfate needs to use up first
> Quenching
H+ neuralised by carbonates - remove acid catalyst
not using alkali            - i2 rx

Total entropy change = sys + sur
sys = dSproduct - dSreactant
sur = -dH / t           dH in J

Free energy change = dH - TdS

2 factors increasing total entropy change
1. n of molecules ^ / state ^ -> dSsys ^ > 0
2. Temperature ^ -> dSsur v

dG <= 0, dSt >= 0, reaction spontaneous hence feasible
Solubility of ionic solid deduced with dSt of dissolving reaction

The enthalpy measured at 100kpa and 298k
rx      - equation quantities of materials react
combus  - substance is completely burned in oxygen
neu     - h2o is produced by neutralisation
forma   - substance formed from its elements in standard states

1 mol of [X] formed from 1 mol [Y]
atom    - grd g
el affin- g gi-
ie      - g gi+

sol     - si aqi by dissolve H2O form solution of infinite dilution
hydr    - gi aqi by dissolve H2O form solution of infinite dilution
LE (frm)- gi s
LE (dis)- [frm rvse] by complete dissociation

Frm & Dis:
Same value due to measure of ionic bonding
Diff sign due to opposite processes
Formation -ve energy released from making bonds
Dissociation +ve energy required to break bonds

LE & Hydration: Charge density ^ -> dH mag ^

Experimental LE: cal born haber cycle
Theoretical LE: cal ionic model

E > T due to additional covalent bonding

Due to assumptions:
1. Ions are touching each other
2. Ions are perfectly spherical
3. Charge is evenly distributed around the center

Charge density difference ^ / EN difference ^ -> Polarization ^
Polarization ^ -> Covalency ^ -> LE % difference ^ -> solubility in H2O ^
Why Ag compounds have higher solubility: outermost shell 4d10 which offers less shielding than most cations -> Covalency ++

dHea 1: always -ve: electron and proton attracted, releasing energy
dHea 1g0: always +ve: full outermost shell, so new e would be in new shell
dHea 2: always +ve : energy required to overcome repulsion betweens ions and e

Kc = [p()]n/[r()]n (lg)
1. At a given temperature
2. Concentrations at Eq

Kp = (pp)n/(pr)n (g)
2. Pressures at Eq

mol fraction xa = mol A / sum mol gases
partial pressure A = xa * total pressure

Temperature shift eq -> change ratio
Pressure and concentration do not affect K as at Eq effect balances out, since the partial pressure of all things changed

Qc = Kc
2. Concentrations defined at instance

K, Q units are derived

K > Q, Eq ->
Change P -> Change Q ratio -> Opposite change for K -> Affect Eq

dSt = RlnK

Acid                - proton donor 
Base                - proton acceptor 
Strong X            - dissociates completely to ions 
Weak X              - dissociates to a small extent to ions 
Conjugate acid      - species formed when base accepts a proton 
Conjugate base      - species formed when acid donates a proton 
Acidic solution     - [H+] > [OH-] 
Alkaline solution   - [H+] < [OH-] 
Amphoteric          - solution which can act as both base and acid

# pH calculations
pH = -log[H+]
[H+] ^ pH v more acidic

> Weak acids and bases' pH
Ka = [H+]2 / [HA]

> Strong bases
Strong bases completely dissociate in water: [OH-] = [BOH]
Kw = [H+][OH-]

> Assumptions
- Water & acid does not dissociate to change [H+]

# Strengths of acid and base
Strong acids: Halids H2SO4 HNO3
Strong bases: MOH
Weak bases: NH3

# Titration pH-conc. curve
Vertical region of titration curve: Equivalence point
Initial increase in pH due to [HA] >> [A-]
If acid added to base, [H+]^ pH v
At half equivalence volume pH = pKa

# Buffer solutions
Buffer solution - Solution which resist changes in pH when small volumes of acid or base are added.
Formed from: weak AB + conjugate AB / salt 
Buffer solution pH: if conjugate formed from a weak acid or base

> Resistance of change of pH
1. Excess amounts of HA & A-
2. Added acid reacts wit A- / added base reacts with HA
3. Ratio of HA to A- remains unchanged

1. Non-superimposable mirror images of one another
2. Presence of a chiral center
3. Molecular formula with different arrangements in space.

Gas used in GC must be inert
GC separation reason: attraction of species to stationary phase
Colum separation reason: attraction of species to stationary & mobile phase
