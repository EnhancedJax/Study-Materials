sd = sqrt(sum2/n - (sum/n)2)

Interpolation: val - B / A - B = pos - Bf / Af - Bf

coded y = ax + b:
mean y = a meanx + b
var y = a^2 varx

# Histogram
Bar {w = class interval, h = fd}
fd = frequency / class interval * scale
So area = frequnecy

# Skewness
Lean left = +ve skew
Q2 - Q1 < Q3 - Q2 
Median < Mean 
Skew towards: arrow

# Comparing data
Location
- Median 
- Skewness
Spread
- IQR
- SD
- Range

For skewed data, use Median & IQR
because: less affected by extreme values

# Probabilitiy
A given that B: P(A|B) = P(AUB)/P(B)
Independent events: P(ANB) = P(A) * P(B)
Mutually exclusive: P(AUB) = P(A) + P(B)

# Data correlation
Strong positive correlation = Linearly displaced with +ve slope

Value of PMCC (r) not affected by coding
Practical meaning: when x ^ y ^ or v
Absolute relationship r = 1

Regression line: y - y = Sxy/Sxx (x - x)

# Random variables
sum P(X=x) = 1
E(X) = sum [x * P(X=x)]
E(X^2) = sum [x^2 * P(X=x)]
Var(X) = E(X^2) - E(X)^2

Y = aX + b
E(Y) = a E(X) + b
Var(Y) = a^2 Var(X)
Which value, outcome or prob is affected by coding: outcome (x)

# Normal dist
Standardizing: P(X < x) = phi([x-mu]/sigma)
P (a < Z < b) = PhiB - PhiA
P (Z > c) = 1- PhiC
