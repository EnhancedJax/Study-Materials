Interpolation: 

# Histogram
Bar {w = , h = }
Frequency density =  * scale
So area = 

# Skewness
Lean left = 
Using quartiles to calculate skew: 
Using mean media to calculate skew: 

# Comparing data

For skewed data, use 

# Probabilitiy
A given that B: P(A|B) = 
Independent events: 
Mutually exclusive: 

# Data correlation
Strong positive correlation = 

Value of PMCC (r) 
Practical meaning: 

Regression line: 

# Random variables
sum P(X=x) = 
E(X) = 
E(X^2) = 
Var(X) = 

Y = aX + b
E(Y) = 
Var(Y) = 

# Normal dist
Standardizing: P(X < x) =
