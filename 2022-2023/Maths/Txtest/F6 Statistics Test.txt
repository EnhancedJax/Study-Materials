Interpolation: 

coded y = ax + b:
mean y = 
var y = 

# Histogram
Bar {w = , h = }
Frequency density =  * scale
So area = 

# Skewness
Lean left = 
Using quartiles to calculate skew: 
Using mean median to calculate skew: 
Skew towards: 

# Comparing data

For skewed data, use 
because: 

# Position of data value with Quartile criteria
1. Added 
2. Added 

# Probabilitiy
A given that B: P(A|B) = 
Independent events: 
Mutually exclusive: 

# Types of distrubtion in P1
1. 
2. 

# Data correlation
Strong positive correlation = 

Sxy = 
Similar, but not the same as SD!

Value of PMCC (r) 
Practical meaning: 
Absolute relationship r = 

Regression line: 

# Random variables
sum P(X=x) = 
E(X) = 
E(X^2) = 
Var(X) = 

Y = aX + b
E(Y) = 
Var(Y) = 
Which value, outcome or prob, is affected by coding: 

# Normal dist
Standardizing: P(X < x) = 
P (a < Z < b) = 
P (Z > c) =
